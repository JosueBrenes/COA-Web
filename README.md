**Citizen of Arcanis: Your Story is the Horizon**
A persistent, living world shaped by its players.

Arcanis is a post-apocalyptic city where every action matters—one player can start wars, disrupt markets, or forever alter the balance between factions. No resets, no safe paths: every decision leaves permanent scars.

**Three Factions, One Uncertain Fate**
Chaos Mercenaries, Supreme Law, and Rebel Technomancers battle for control over arcane technology. Your chosen side determines your weapons, missions, territories, and access to markets. Today you may lead a faction; tomorrow, betray it and become its most wanted enemy.

**Living Economy and Black Markets**
A global market governed by core rules to prevent runaway inflation, and a black market accessible only in special zones dominated by the Chaos Mercenaries. Players influence prices, rarities, and trade flows from the very first demo.

**A Metaverse of Emergent Stories**
Global events will determine territory and alliances. The top player in each faction can become its actual leader. Community-created arcades and minigames will expand the universe, unlocking achievements and tokens.

**Legacy Secured**
Everything you do is recorded. Even if you stop playing, your name, betrayals, and conquests will continue to shape the world. Here, you’re not just an avatar—you are living history.
